# Play_with_Stock
Use time series to make predctions of stock market

## Inspiration
Make predictions of the stock market. 

## What it does
Deploy time series analysis to make a reasonable analysis.

## How I built it
This model is built in Python and majorly used the library, "Investpy"

## Challenges I ran into
Hard to deploy a machine learning method and keep track of the most current data.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
The linear regression result is close to the actual result of the stock market.

## What I learned
1. Time series analysis 
2. ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)

## What's next for Stock Predict Model
Deploy machine learning to make more accurate predictions.
